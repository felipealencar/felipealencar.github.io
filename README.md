# Personal website

This repository is based on the github's basic kickstart personal website [`github/personal-website` repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website). It automatically renders a webpage with my profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories.

I just changed some style and content to satisfy my needs. It includes space to highlight my specific areas of interest in research projects, papers, and software development, like languages or industries. It also enables me to publish some blog posts.
